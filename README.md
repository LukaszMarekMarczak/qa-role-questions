# QA Role Questions

**Some of those questions are vague on purpose and their interpretation is up to you.**

**The format of how you provide the answers will also be taken into account.**

1) Please describe what were the most common bugs you have found in web applications you were working with (desktop only)
  The most common bugs in desktop application were server connection error, database connection error and defects related to functional   requirements.
2) Please describe what were the most common bugs you have found in mobile applications you were working with (native mobile apps)
  The most common bugs in mobile apps I was testing were problems related to network connection bugs, defects related to data             compatibility after overinstalations and also bugs related to functional requirements.
3) What is your usual process of reporting bugs to developers ?
  After I find a bug I'm verifing that is it really a bug and then (if it's a bug) I'm reporting it in bug tracking tool and inform       devs.
4) How did your day look like in your recent QA related role ?
  My day depends on procjects stage. Mostly I'm starting a day with bugs retest, then I have a daily stand-up and after that I'm testing   functional requierments, executing regression tests or analysing production bugs.
5) What problems have you experienced during your collaboration with developers ?
  I didn't have any problems with dev coopertian. Sometimes they won't to take responsibility for bugs and won't to fix them but it's a   very rare situation.
6) What are the top 3 types of bugs which are the most annoying / problematic ?
  I think the most annoying/problematic bugs are bug which appears random or bugs I cannot reproduce (one-time bugs) or returning bugs. 
7) What was the most critical bug that you have found ?
  It was an app crash after login ;)
8) How do you prefer to receive feedback from the development team ?
  I think the brst way is a talk cause we can save some time and feedback can be better understood.
9) Which technical areas are you interested in ?
  I have a very basic expirience in tests automation using java tools and I would like to develop my automation skills.
10) Which tools / apps do you use when debugging apps (you can list anything that makes your life easier)
  I was using Android Debug Bridge. My life is easier aldso thanks to Firebug, Jenkins, Bitbucket, Postman, TestLink and bug tracking     tools.
11) How do you deal with regression testing ? (this question is vague on purpose)
  That's not the only one question which is vague ;) I'm dealing with them very well. I'm doing a list of regression test cases and       trying to automize most of them or if it's possible and profitable - all of them. The list is complemented during the projects run.
12) Assuming that you were the head of a 4 people QA team, how would you organise everything ?
  I would allocate the work to each QA according to his/hers skills and oversee their progress to know we're are we with the work         progress, how much time we need to end tests and control if someone need help with completing his/hers task.
13) How would you optimise QA processes in your previous roles ?
  If I could make some decisions I would like to increase the possibility of decision making
14) How do you deal with maintenance issues in a QA team ? (this question is ambiguous on purpose)
  If there're any problems in QA team I think the best thing is meet and discuss how to solve them. 
15) If you were to give me an advice about how to approach QA in general , what would it be ?
  At first you should at least read e.g. ISTQB syllabus or other documents which gives you a theoretical knowledge about quality           assurance. The second step should be a certified training and practice.
16) Why did you chose a QA Engineer role ?
  I choose it cause finding bugs and helping with developing high quality software gives me satisfaction. I was able to try to work as a   QA when I was an insurance advisor and I liked it.
17) What are the biggest problems / challenges that you see in a role of a QA Engineer ?
  I think the biggest problem is that QA team / QA Engineer role is very often disregard in software development.
18) How would you solve the problems / challenges from the previous question ?
  The solution to the above problem is to aware stakeholders and decision makers how important is QA team in software developing           process.
19) Assuming that you suddenly need to decide between 5 major features / project in terms of what should be a priority for QA and there is no one to ask for a priority list, how would you chose a single feature / project to test over the next few days and based on what ? (describe you logic behind it)
  I would choose using documentation and trying to find paths the most often used by application users.
20) What else would you like to tell me ? :)
  Great questions. Congrats to the author.
